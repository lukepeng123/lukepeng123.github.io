## Good Design vs. Bad Design



#### Good Design

  Google (the web browser specifically) is used by pretty much everyone who has access to the internet. It's easy to use, helpful, and free. The internet has an enourmous amount of information that can be specific for someone's needs or just a quick fact. The easiest way to access this huge pool of information is by using a web browser. Being able to see images, defenifitions, and watch videos by typing a word into a program is extremeley helpful. Google also provides things like autocorrect through searches and will display related things to a search, making life much easier for the user.

#### Bad Design

  Do you ever feel like trying _Run Race 3D_? No? Well how about _Fun Race 3D_? Or _Fun Run 3D_? There are a ton of mobile games, and most of them now are made in 5 minutes or less, and are often a copy of another game. They are minimum effort games that do not last. Many games will have an element of originality or require an amount of skill to win, which will make a user want to keep going back. Many of the mobile games provide one motion for the entire game, which may keep a user satisfied for a few minutes befoe they look for another game. They have nothing that will want to make a user keep playing and are mostly not original whatsoever.
