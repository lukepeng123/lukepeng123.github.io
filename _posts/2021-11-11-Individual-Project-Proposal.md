## Individual Project Proposal - Dismissals and Crowds

One major problem at school is dismissal. It’s very hectic and many people struggle to find their buses and leave on time. From the Fly on the Wall Labs and also just from my experience every day at school, the area near the buses is extremely hectic due to people wanting to see the board and also from students choosing to hang out near the board. It would be extremely convenient for people to know where the bus is and if it’s already here. The existing system, which is just a whiteboard that gets updated constantly by the faculty, works pretty smoothly most of the time. However, there is always human error and the area around it gets extremely crowded. The students at HM also don’t exactly try to cooperate and mostly just wait out the crowds or go through them. Also, the teachers and faculty that have bus duty wouldn’t have to spend half an hour dismissing students if this problem was resolved. Dismissals are a major inconvenience for everyone, faculty included, and the problem could be lessened with some engagement from the students. Crowds at dismissals and during school hours are formed due to the lack of action or lack of awareness of the students. Many students choose to have a conversation with their friends in rather inconvenient places, which increases the size of the crowds, especially at dismissals. Some action taken by the students at HM could decrease the size of the problem significantly and make life easier for those working at dismissals and those who are trying to get through the crowds.
