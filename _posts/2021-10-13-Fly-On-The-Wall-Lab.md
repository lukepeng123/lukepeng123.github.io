## Fly On The Wall


#### Observations



#### Analysis



#### Process

The process I took to gather my observations were quite simple. My partner, Sawyer Scheiner, and I walked around campus writing down everything we saw that was slightly noteworthy. We focused on the quantity of the obeservations, and when we felt like we had enough, we cut off the more pointless or obvious observations. I think we could have paid more attention to the smaller details of things when we were walking around campus, but our method was effective nonetheless.
