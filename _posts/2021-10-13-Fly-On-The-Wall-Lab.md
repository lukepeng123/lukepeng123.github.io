#### Observations

We observed daily life at Horace Mann in a "fly on the wall" format, meaning that we, like a fly on a wall, collected data by seeing and listening. Here are the things we collected by walking around on campus:

- Field filled with people playing sports: spikeball, soccer balls and goals, footbal, volleyball
- Tents with chairs for outside classes eating
- Bleachers to sit down, watch sports games, do work
- Hallways generally empty during class time, the field is populated with people on the field or on/around the bleachers
- Between classes there are many people going to class, using their phones, and hanging out near the stairways
- The library always has some amount of people in it doing work, playing videogames, or hanging out with friends
- The cafateria during lunch is very crowded
- Push doors with handles in Lutnick and Fisher, bad signifier for the door
- The fences around the field are pretty low, a ball could go flying over them
- The field during frees is filled with people playing sports

#### Analysis

Students mostly have two objectives in their activities during their free time: to complete work or to enjoy some time with their friends. During free periods, students are able to participate in a variety of activites in various places around campus. Student quality of life is a priority for the school, so there is a lot of space for students to hang out or play sports. Alumni field is a massive and extremely open space for students, and there are also many areas students can go to study or enjoy some quiet, such as the library or the bottom of Fisher Hall. The cafateria is another space students go to during their free time for food or for a spot to relax with friends. Open spaces like the field can become a hazard sometimes, as many of the students are playing sports. A stray ball may hit a student who is not paying attention, and the fields can get very crowded at times like break. The cafeteria is also extremely populated during D and E period, so the amount of people in that one spcae can become a hazard. However, places like the library and the bottom of Fisher Hall are not overcrowded, so they are an excellent place to find some quiet and do some work. Students will often be seen with footballs, soccerbals, and volleyballs on the main field and be using their phones and laptops outside of the field. The only other people on campusare the teachers, who do not usually interact with the students besides a quick hello. To conclude, the quality of life for students is very good. There is a lot of space for students and many different areas that present different environments. There is a place to do work, a place to eat, and a place to hang out or play sports.

#### Process

The process I took to gather my observations were quite simple. My partner, Sawyer Scheiner [(His website)](https://sawyerscheiner.github.io), and I walked around campus writing down everything we saw that was slightly noteworthy. We focused on the quantity of the obeservations, and when we felt like we had enough, we cut off the more pointless or obvious observations. I think we could have paid more attention to the smaller details of things when we were walking around campus; we just wrote our observations down without much thought. I also think we could have picked better times, as no one was walking around during H period in the hallways, but our methods was effective nonetheless.
